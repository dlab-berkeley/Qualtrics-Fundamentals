This repository contains the materials for D-Lab [WorkshopName] workshop. 

### Prerequisites
We recommend attending [D-LabWorkshop1](D-LabWorkshop1Link),
[D-LabWorkshop2](D-LabWorkshop2Link), and
[AdditionalWorkshopsAsNeeded](LinksToWorkshops) prior to this workshop.

Check D-Lab's [Learning Pathways](https://dlab-berkeley.github.io/dlab-workshops/python_path.html) to figure out which of our workshops to take!

## Workshop Goals

In this workshop, we provide [WorkshopGoal]. First, we’ll cover [Aim1]. Then,
we’ll explore [Aim2]. 

_Only if necessary:_ If you are not familiar with material in
[D-LabWorkshop1](D-LabWorkshop1Link), [D-LabWorkshop2](D-LabWorkshop2Link), and
[AdditionalWorkshopsAsNeeded](LinksToWorkshops), we recommend attending those
workshops first.

## Learning Objectives

After this workshop, you will be able to:

- [LearningObjective1].
- [LearningObjective2].
- [LearningObjective3].

This workshop does not cover the following:

- [NotCovered1]. These are covered in [D-LabWorkshopName](URL).
- [NotCovered2]. These are covered in [D-LabWorkshopName](URL).


## Installation Instructions

We will use [RStudio/Python] to go through the workshop materials, which requires installation of [Software]. Complete the following steps:

1. This step(s) details software to download, with a link.
2. Download these workshop materials:
    * Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository information.
    * Click "Download Zip".
    * Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (we recommend Desktop).
3. Optional: if you’re familiar with git, you can instead clone this repository by opening a terminal and entering [GitCloneCommand].

## Is [Language] not Working on Your Computer?

If you do not have [Language] installed and the materials loaded on your
workshop by the time it starts, we *strongly* recommend using the UC Berkeley
Datahub to run the materials for these lessons. You can access the DataHub by
clicking the following button:

[![DataHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/launch-datahub-blue)](DATAHUB_LINK_HERE)

The DataHub downloads this repository, along with any necessary packages, and
allows you to run the materials in an RStudio instance on UC Berkeley's servers.
No installation is necessary from your end - you only need an internet browser
and a CalNet ID to log in. By using the DataHub, you can save your work and come
back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go
straight to the [D-Lab DataHub](https://dlab.datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and
you click on the `[Workshop-Name]` folder.

If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can still run these lessons in the cloud, by clicking this button:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](BINDER_LINK_HERE)

By using this button, however, you cannot save your work.


## Run the Code

Now that you have all the required software and materials, you need to run the code:

Provide instructions on running the code, including how to load relevant software (RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks, etc.) and which file to open up. See other repositories for examples.

Additionally, provide instructions on how to run code once it’s open (running Jupyter cells, RMarkdown cells, etc.).
