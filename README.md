## Workshop Goals

Qualtrics is a powerful online tool available to Berkeley community members that can be used for a range of data collection activities. Primarily, Qualtrics is designed to make web surveys easy to write, test, and implement, but the software can be used for data entry, training, quality control, evaluation, market research, pre/post-event feedback, and other uses with some creativity. 

In this two-part workshop, we provide an introduction to using Qualtrics. In the first part, we'll cover how to use the platform and its features to create, distribute, and analyze surveys. In the second part, we'll discuss best practices for survey design.

## Learning Objectives

After this workshop, you will be able to:

- Design and distribute your own surveys in Qualtrics.
- Incorporate good survey design practices into your own surveys.
