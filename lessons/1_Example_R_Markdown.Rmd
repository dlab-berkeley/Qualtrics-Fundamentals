## Learning Objectives

Welcome to <workshop name>. Our goals for today's workshop are:

1.  \<Learning objective 1. Use [learning objective verbs](https://swcarpentry.github.io/swc-releases/2016.06/instructor-training/20-lessons/).\>

2.  \<Learning objective 2. Use [learning objective verbs](https://swcarpentry.github.io/swc-releases/2016.06/instructor-training/20-lessons/).\>

3.  \<Learning objective 3. Use [learning objective verbs](https://swcarpentry.github.io/swc-releases/2016.06/instructor-training/20-lessons/).\>

Throughout this workshop series, we will use the following icons:

🔔 **Question**: A quick question to help you understand what's going on.

🥊 **Challenge**: Interactive exercise. We'll go through these in the workshop!

⚠️ **Warning**: Heads-up about tricky stuff or common mistakes.

💡 **Tip**: How to do something a bit more efficiently or effectively.

📝 **Poll**: A zoom poll to help you learn.

🎬 **Demo**: Showing off something more advanced so you know what you can use R for in the future

## Section Name

Main sections should be an H1 (one hashtag) header, in Title Case, following [APA rules](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case).

Be sure to have text between code cells explaining the material, step-by-step.

Keep the following in mind:

-   Keep narrative text limited!

-   Avoid discussion of edge cases or caveats.

-   Use colloquial languague and minimal jargon; if you need it, explain it.

-   Use **boldface** to highlight key concepts and important terms, but use it sparingly.

-   Don't use italics.

-   Use en-dash for lists.

-   Use `code font` for anything in code like variables, functions, and packages.

-   Use `code font` for menu items (like `Restart Kernel`), and data frame rows/columns.

-   When discussing functions, include the trailing parentheses (e.g. `print()`).

-   When discussing methods, include the dot (e.g. `.sum()`).

-   Consistently use emoji for relevant sections. See below for some examples.

## Subsection Name

Use H2 headers for subsections, in Title Case, following [APA rules](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case). These **do not** need to be linked to in the Sections at the top of the notebook.

```{r}

# In general we follow the tidyverse style guide: https://style.tidyverse.org/

# Coding style: 
# Use snake case and single quotation marks, unless your string includes single quotation marks.
# Most operators are surrounded with a single space.

# Comments:
# Use comments sparingly
# Comments start with a capital letter, and a space between the hashtag and the first word

# Data: 
# use relevant social science datasets whenever you can. 
# Think health data, demographics, etc.
# Stay away from "impersonal" datasets like the Iris or Penguins dataset.
# Use the top-level "data" folder in the repo to store data
```

## 🥊 Challenge <number>:

<title of challenge>

### *Example:*

## 🥊 Challenge 3: Creating Variables from Other Variables

Pick a country. Look up its population and create a variable which stores the population. Now look up the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and create another variable which stores the GDP.

Can you use these two variables to create a third variable which stores the GDP per capita (GDP divided by population)?

```{r}
# You may have some starter code for the challenge that you can put in its own cell.
# Always have a following cell that says "YOUR CODE HERE" with a few empty lines beneath it, so that attendees know where to put their code.
```

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE

```

##  💡 Tip: [Name of Tip]

-   Tips can be formatted as subsection (\##) when they're more substantial. Title Case applies.
-   Tips use the 💡 Electric Light Bulb Emoji in the header.
-   Tips are not numbered.
-   Keep them short and to the point.
-   See the Jupyter notebook template for an example.

🔔 **Question:**

-   Questions are used without header. -

-   uestions use the 🔔 Bell Emoji at the start of the line, followed by boldface **Question:**, followed by the question.

-   Questions are short queries about code or concepts.

-   Questions do not require participants to enter code.

-   Questions can be used as attention checks, and discussed during the workshop.

***Example:***

🔔 **Question**: what will the output of the following code be?

📝 **Poll \<Name, Number\>**

-   Polls refer to Zoom polls, which can be used as a form of formative assessment.
-   Talk to D-Lab staff if you want to create Zoom polls before adding them in the notebook.
-   Polls use the 📝 memo enoji at the start of the line, followed by boldface **Poll**, followed by the name of the poll.
-   Polls are named with the format {workshop name}{workshop part - poll number} - make sure to check if they are **activated** by clicking "Polls/Quizzes" in Zoom.
-   Polls are used without header.

### *Example:*

📝 **Poll RFun 1-1:** Why are only some of the columns visible in the output?

## 🎬 Demo: <Title Of Demo>

-   Demos can be used at the end of a notebook to show / highlight some advanced functionalities outside the scope of the workshop.

-   Demos are written as main sections (\#) that are linked to in the "Sections" section. Title Case applies.

-   Demos use the 🎬 Clapper Board Emoji at the start of the header.

-   Demos can used once per notebook.

-   Demos can be used to enthuse participants, and to point them to relevant other D-Lab workshops.

-   Demos are meant to be short: 5-10 mins max.

### *Example:*

## 🎬 Demo: Next Time...

Most of the time, you won't be working with single value variables or vectors. Instead, you'll be working with data that contains multiple variables. In Part 2, we will learn how to read in data to R and create **data frames** (a way to store data with multiple rows and columns).

🔔 **Tip:** Run the two chunks of code below. What do you think we are doing?

```{r}
# read in data
gap <- read.csv(file = "../data/gapminder.csv")
head(gap)

```

```{r}
# subset data
gap[gap$country == "Mexico", c("country", "year", "pop")] 


```
