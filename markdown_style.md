# General style for Markdown Files

### General style

- File title is in Title Case, starts with a single digit, and uses underscores to separate between words. We follow APA Style Guide for capitalization: https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case. This means you should not capitalize minor words.
- Notebook title is H1 and includes Workshop Name: Subtitle
- Keep the scaffolding at the top and bottom of the template notebook intact
- Use H1 for main headers that are referred to in the "Sections" section.
- All headers are in Title Case. We follow APA Style Guide: https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case. This means you should not capitalize minor words.
- Use H2 for subsections. These do not need to be linked to in the "Sections" section at the top of the notebook.
- Use H3 headers for subsubsections. Don't go lower than H3 if you can avoid it.
- Use emoji specified in the "Icons Used in This Notebook" section
- Keep narrative text limited!
- Avoid discussion of edge cases or caveats.
- Use colloquial language and minimal jargon; if you need it, explain it.
- Use **boldface** to highlight key concepts and important terms, but use it sparingly.
- Don't use italics.
- Use en-dash for lists.
- Use `code font` for anything in code like variables, functions, and packages.
- Use `code font` for menu items and UX pathways (like `Restart Kernel` or `Kernel-> Restart`)
- Use `code font` for data frame rows/columns.
- When discussing functions, include the trailing parentheses (e.g. `print()`).
- When discussing methods, include the dot (e.g. `.sum()`).
- Consistently use emoji for relevant sections. See below for some examples.
